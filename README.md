Heart disease detection (Must): The Heart Disease Prediction problem aims to develop a model that can accurately predict
the likelihood of an individual having heart disease based on various medical and lifestyle factors. Given a dataset
containing information such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and other relevant clinical
indicators, the goal is to build a predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in early detection and
intervention for heart disease.
